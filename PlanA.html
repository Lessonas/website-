  <h1>The West Virginia State Police Death, Disability and Retirement Fund (Plan A)</h1>
  <p>
    The West Virginia State Police Death, Disability and Retirement Fund, commonly referred to as Plan A, was established for all state troopers on July 1, 1935. Chapter 15, Article 2 of the West Virginia Code establishes the plan provisions for Plan A. During the 1994 Legislative Session, the West Virginia Legislature enacted Chapter 15, Article 2A of the West Virginia Code that established a new retirement plan for all state troopers hired on or after March 12, 1994. That plan was entitled the West Virginia State Police Retirement System, now commonly referred to as Plan B. State troopers hired on or after March 12, 1994 are not eligible for membership in Plan A. Civilian employees of the West Virginia State Police are members of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).
  </p>
  <p>
    Active members of Plan A contribute 9% of their total gross salary into the retirement plan for the member Normal Cost. The employer contributes an additional amount sufficient to fund the Plan benefits on an actuarially determined basis including both the employer Normal Cost plus amortizing the unfunded actuarial accrued liability through Fiscal Year 2025 (the ARC). The State also contributes other monies to the system through arrest fees, accident report fees, criminal investigation reports, etc. Members of Plan A are not covered by Social Security or Workers’ Compensation.
  </p>

  <h2>Retirement Benefits:</h2>
  <!-- <p>
    <a href="#">PDF print friendly version</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <a href="#">Print friendly version</a>
  </p> -->

  <p>
    In order to qualify for full retirement benefits, a member must be 50 years of age with 20 years of contributory service (excluding Military Service), OR any age with 25 years of credited service (including Military Service). A member who is less than 50 years of age with 20 years of credited service (excluding Military Service), qualifies for a deferred benefit at age 50. An employee of the agency who terminates employment after completing 10 years of service with the agency, but prior to eligibility for normal retirement, who leaves his or her contributions on deposit with the fund is eligible for deferred retirement benefits beginning at age 62.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are no regular or deferred retirement benefits available for a member with less than 10 years of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    The regular retirement benefit, payable in equal monthly installments, is equal to 5.5% of the employee’s aggregate salary paid during his or her whole period of service as an employee of the agency, but not less than $6,000 annually. This benefit is payable during the lifetime of the retiree.
  </p>
  <p>
    The very first benefit payment due to a retiree or beneficiary will be mailed directly to the recipient’s home address. Following the first payment, benefit payments are credited by direct deposit to retiree accounts on the 25th of each month, except the month of December, when retiree accounts are credited on the 18th. If the 25th (or December 18th) falls on a weekend or holiday, direct deposits are processed on the prior full business day.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Sick and Annual Leave at Retirement</h3>
  <p>
    Any member of the fund who participates in a Public Employees Insurance Agency (PEIA) insurance plan at the time of retirement may elect to use accrued annual and/or sick leave towards an increase in retirement benefits. This accrued leave may be applied on the basis of 2 days retirement service credit for each 1 day of accrued annual or sick leave. However, such credited service shall not be used in meeting initial eligibility for retirement. In the alternative to increasing retirement benefits, certain members who currently participate in a PEIA insurance plan may be eligible to elect to use unused annual and/or sick leave at the time of retirement to purchase health insurance under the PEIA. Please contact PEIA for further information.<br>
    Accrued leave cannot be divided and used for both service credit and PEIA coverage.
  </p>

  <h3>Termination of Employment</h3>
  <p>
    An employee of the agency who terminates employment may receive a refund of all employee contributions he or she has contributed into the fund plus 4% interest compounded annually. Any member of the fund who withdraws his or her contributions forfeits all rights to any future retirement or disability benefits under this fund.
  </p>
