  <h1>West Virginia State Police Retirement System (Plan B)</h1>
  <p>
    The West Virginia State Police Retirement System, commonly referred to as Plan B, was established by the enactment of Chapter 15, Article 2A of the West Virginia Code during the 1994 Legislative Session for all state troopers hired on or after March 12, 1994. Civilian employees of the West Virginia State Police are members of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).
  </p>
  <p>
    Active members of Plan B contribute 13% of their base salary into the retirement plan. The employer contributes 34% of base salary into the plan. Members of this retirement system are not covered by Social Security or Workers' Compensation.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Retirement Benefits:</h2>
  
  <!-- <p>
    <a href="#">PDF print friendly version</a> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <a href="#">Print friendly version</a>
  </p> -->

  <p><strong>Regular Retirement:</strong> A member must be 50 years of age with 25 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service) or age 52 with 20 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service).</p>
  <p><strong>Early Retirement:</strong> A member who is less than 52 years of age qualifies for a reduced benefit as long as he or she has 20 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service).</p>
  <p><strong>Deferred Retirement:</strong> A member who has 10 years of service, who elects to leave his or her contributions on deposit with the retirement system, is eligible for deferred retirement benefits beginning at age 62. The annuity shall be payable to the retiree during his or her lifetime in the form of a regular retirement annuity or the retiring member may choose an annuity in an actuarially adjusted amount payable during the retiree's lifetime, with one half of the adjusted monthly amount paid to his or her surviving spouse for the spouse's remaining lifetime after the death of the retiree.</p>

  <p><strong>There are no regular, early or deferred retirement benefits available for a member with less than 10 years of service.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Regular retirement benefits are paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to 3.00% multiplied by the years of service multiplied by the Final Average Salary (FAS). The Final Average Salary is the average of the highest annual compensation received for employment with the agency, including compensation paid for overtime service, received by the employee during any 5 calendar years within the employee's last 10 years of service. This benefit is payable during the lifetime of the retiree.</p>
  <p><strong>FAS x Years of Service x 3.00% = Annual Retirement Benefit</strong></p>
  
  <p>
    The very first benefit payment due to a retiree or beneficiary will be mailed directly to the recipient's home address. Following the first payment, benefit payments are credited by direct deposit to retiree accounts on the 25th of each month, except the month of December, when retiree accounts are credited on the 18th. If the 25th (or December 18th) falls on a weekend or holiday, direct deposits are processed on the prior full business day.
