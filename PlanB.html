  </p> -->

  <p><strong>Regular Retirement:</strong> A member must be 50 years of age with 25 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service) or age 52 with 20 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service).</p>
  <p><strong>Early Retirement:</strong> A member who is less than 52 years of age qualifies for a reduced benefit as long as he or she has 20 or more years of credited service (excluding Military Service).</p>
  <p><strong>Deferred Retirement:</strong> A member who has 10 years of service, who elects to leave his or her contributions on deposit with the retirement system, is eligible for deferred retirement benefits beginning at age 62. The annuity shall be payable to the retiree during his or her lifetime in the form of a regular retirement annuity or the retiring member may choose an annuity in an actuarially adjusted amount payable during the retiree's lifetime, with one half of the adjusted monthly amount paid to his or her surviving spouse for the spouse's remaining lifetime after the death of the retiree.</p>

  <p><strong>There are no regular, early or deferred retirement benefits available for a member with less than 10 years of service.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Regular retirement benefits are paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to 3.00% multiplied by the years of service multiplied by the Final Average Salary (FAS). The Final Average Salary is the average of the highest annual compensation received for employment with the agency, including compensation paid for overtime service, received by the employee during any 5 calendar years within the employee's last 10 years of service. This benefit is payable during the lifetime of the retiree.</p>
  <p><strong>FAS x Years of Service x 3.00% = Annual Retirement Benefit</strong></p>
  
  <p>
    The very first benefit payment due to a retiree or beneficiary will be mailed directly to the recipient's home address. Following the first payment, benefit payments are credited by direct deposit to retiree accounts on the 25th of each month, except the month of December, when retiree accounts are credited on the 18th. If the 25th (or December 18th) falls on a weekend or holiday, direct deposits are processed on the prior full business day.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Retirement Benefits Are Not Automatic.</strong> You must apply to the Board for your retirement benefits. Distributions must start by April 1 of the year following the later of: a) the date you reach age 72 if you were born before January 1, 1951; b) the date you reach age 73 if you were born after December 31, 1950; or c) the date upon which you terminate employment.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)</h3>
  <p>
    Every retiree of the system who is 63 years of age or older and who is retired under normal retirement criteria will receive an annual retirement annuity adjustment of 1% payable on July 1 of each year after the retiree attains 63 years of age.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every retiree of the system who is retired under the disability retirement provisions and every surviving spouse receiving a benefit under the provisions of this retirement system are eligible to receive the annual retirement annuity adjustment of 1% payable on July 1 of each year following commencement of benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the retiree has been retired for less than one year or if the surviving spouse has been in receipt of surviving spouse payments for less than one year on that July 1, that first annuity adjustment will be a pro rata share of the full year's annuity adjustment following commencement of benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any retiree choosing to receive a deferred annuity is not eligible to receive the annual annuity adjustment.
  </p>
